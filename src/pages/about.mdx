# About

Paulie API is a standalone API and documentation site. It accepts request from a restricted list of `origins` for various functionality required for a number of my own websites.

All of the sites listed below use this API. Some of the functionality required has been abstracted to this API for one of two reasons:

1. The Serverless Function is used by more one entity
2. The origin site is not built using Gatsby and can't run it's own Serverless Functions

I've shorthanded this functionality to mean the following:

#### SOF: Same Origin Functions

This means that the site **can** run it's own Serverless functions and both the Front and Backend run on the same origin.

#### COF: Cross Origin Functions

This means the site **can't** run it's own Serverless Functions or it makes uses of a Serverless Function that is used by another origin.
