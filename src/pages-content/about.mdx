# About

Paulie API is a standalone API and documentation site. It accepts request from a restricted list of `origins` for various functionality required for a number of my own websites.

All of the sites listed below use this API. Some of the functionality required has been abstracted to this API for one of two reasons:

1. The Serverless Function is used by more than one origin
2. The origin site is not built using Gatsby and can't run it's own Serverless Functions

_I've shorthanded this functionality as follows:_

<Grid
    sx={{
        gridTemplateColumns: ['1fr', ['1fr 1fr']]
    }}
>

<Box>

### SOF: Same Origin Function

This means that the site **can** run it's own Serverless functions and both the Front and Backend run on the same origin.

</Box>

<Box>

### COF: Cross Origin Function

This means the site **can't** run it's own Serverless Functions or it makes use of a Serverless Function that is used by more than one origin.

 </Box>

</Grid>
