# More About My Requirements

Paulie API is a standalone API and documentation site. It provides access to a set of
[Serverless Functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/) hosted on
[Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/) that I use in number of my websites.

## Rational

All of the sites listed below use this API and the functionality has been abstracted for one of two reasons:

1. The origin site is not built using Gatsby and can't run it's own Serverless Functions
2. The Serverless Function is used by more than one origin

_I've shorthanded this functionality to mean the following:_

### SOF: Same Origin Function

This means that the site **can** run it's own Serverless Functions and both the Front and Back-end are deployed to the
same origin.

<small>This is denoted using solid lines in the diagram above</small>

### COF: Cross Origin Function

This means the site **can't** run it's own Serverless Functions or it makes use of a Serverless Function that is used by
more than one origin.

<small>This is denoted using dashed lines in the diagram above</small>

## Origins

### paulie.dev

[paulie.dev](https://paulie.dev) is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)

It uses COF's to connect to the `/api/v2/twitter/tweets` and `/api/v2/github/repo` endpoints. It uses is own SOF's to
`POST` and `GET` user reactions stored in a [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) database. It also uses a `GET` request for the
[Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1?hl=en) API to display site
visitors Country locations.

### MDX Embed
